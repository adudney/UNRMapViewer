UNRMapViewer
============

This app loads and renders maps from the games Unreal Tournament and Nerf Arena Blast.
It crashes on the iPad 1, so use the iPad 2 or 3. The iPad 2 will show a white screen while loading some maps, either wait it out, or try a different map.
UMX2-Luna is probably the fastest loading map, so try that one first.

Controls:
---------
(Hold the iPad with the home button on the left for these controls to work)
Tap and drag on the left side of the screen to move around the level.
Tap and drag on the right side of the screen to look around.
